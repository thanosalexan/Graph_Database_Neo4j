# Graph_Database_Neo4j

In this assignment, I am provided with a subset of a citation network dataset, which includes information about authors, articles, journals, and citations between articles. My task is to model this data as a property graph in Neo4j, considering appropriate entities, labels, types, and properties for nodes and edges. The goal is to create a graph database in Neo4j and load the dataset into it, potentially creating indexes to improve query performance. After setting up the database, I am required to write and execute various Cypher queries, including finding top authors by citations and collaborations, authors with the most papers, journal statistics, and more. Additionally, I need to explore the shortest paths between authors using different types of edges and nodes, comparing the results in different scenarios.
